<h1>The Internet: <br> Where Will It Take Us</h1>

<p>
  The Internet has come a long way and in recent years we are seeing a huge advancement of what it can do and what it will eventually be capable of. Now  we have AI that is capable of answering our mundane questions and generating whatever we tell it to. A couple years ago that would have been unthinkable and yet everyday there are more things that people are doing to help further advance what the internet is capable of doing.  In one hundred years, the internet as we know it can be a totally different concept then what we have now. Now we have the internet in the forms of computers, phones, tablets, watches, and now even sunglasses. In the future it can become a screenless concept, something that people can easily have in their vision as screens in the air. Instead of a device, people can have contacts that are capable of being as powerful as iphones and all you would have to do is wave your hand and activate it. The possibilities could be endless, we’d be able to keep each other more connected. With just a wave of your hand, you'd be able to view anything you need to in an instant. 
Messaging people will become as easy as thinking. You would be able to connect through your consciousness with the help of AI. You would be able to have a conversation at any time and it can feel as if you were face to face with the person. Beyond this you’d be able to share memories as if they were images and videos. It would be as clear as if you recorded it with a device. You’d be able to share your emotions directly with someone else and we’d all be able to connect with each other on a much deeper level. 
In one hundred years  the internet could eventually become something that is physically connected to our bodies, it can be very useful in our day to day lives that provide data on our well being and monitor the body. It can be useful to older people who don’t have all round care, they can have a direct connection to hospitals if anything goes wrong. With implants and sensors directly attached to one's body , you could have constant data of  your well being and this could help predict when an incident can occur. Many lives can be saved with the useful and accurate computer predictions of when fatal incidents can occur. This will allow hospitals to be a step ahead and make a decision that can help patients in much earlier stages of whatever they are suffering. 
Over such a long period of time the internet can transform our entertainment and media. Virtual reality will be much more advanced and immersive for people. The internet would have advanced enough to allow people to experience all senses while in virtual reality. You would be able to smell and be able to taste while being in the virtual world. You would even have the power to create your avatar. People will be able to freely create their own virtual identity and experience a second life. It will serve as a digital world for people to be able to create a space in the virtual world. It would be as if you are waking up in another world where you have a whole new life. There would be many other like you as well and eventually a society will be created in the virtual world. With people making it more and more of a stable society it will be as real as your physical world and life. There would be no need to even try to differentiate the two lives. Since everything has become so immersive , every moment will feel real. 
In order to make sure it would even reach a far achievement we would be working hand and hand with the internet, we would communicate with it as if it was alive. We ask for it to establish connections to people we think of and it is able to form the connection. AI would need to be constantly learning to be able to improve and if working directly with the public it is able to learn. It would be a symbiotic relationship and without the other, they would not reach their full potential.
